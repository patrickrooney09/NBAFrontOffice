# NBAFrontOffice

The purpose of this app is to deliver important information to an NBA Front Office. 

This app will take player statistics pulled from balldontlie.io and compare those stats how much their salary is for that given year, or over time. 

This app will be built with Next JS, balldontlie.io API, and Firebase Authentication.
