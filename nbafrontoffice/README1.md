# NBAFrontOffice

The purpose of this app is to deliver important information to an NBA Front Office. 

This app will take player statistics pulled from balldontlie.io and compare those stats how much their salary is for that given year, or over time. The goal is to put a dollar value on statistics. How much money are we paying a player per points, rebounds, assists etc. 
Ideally, we can compare this to other players to analyze current market rate for each position and how much they are paid based on their statistics. 

This app will be built with Next JS, balldontlie.io API, and Firebase Authentication.
